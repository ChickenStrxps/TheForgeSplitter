This project, the Forge Master OCR Assistant, is a custom-built tool designed to eliminate headaches

Drop in a screenshot: click “Drag Image Here” and pick your Forge inventory screenshot. The grid will appear with red slot outlines and blue/green scanners.

If the grid needs shifting or resizing, click “Auto-Align Grid.” If the numbers/names need tuning, click “Auto-Align Num/Name.” You can toggle what gets adjusted (position/size) with the checkboxes below.

Manual tweaks: switch to “Click Slot to Edit,” click a red box, and use the sliders in the modal to nudge the number or name scanners. “Drag Scanners” lets you drag the blue/green boxes directly.

Hit “SCAN GRID” to OCR the slots. The results populate in the right table; edit any cell inline if OCR guessed wrong. “Total Value” updates automatically.

Build your crafting list: pick items from the dropdown, hit “+” to queue them, then “Calculate Resources” to see how many slots fill each item and what ores are used.
